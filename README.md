# Freshworks OpenAPI Style Guide

> This document details the API standard and guidelines defined as part of Freshworks products.

Freshworks products use REST architectural standard for building API capabilities in to our products. Alternative architectural standards such as FALCOR, gRPC, Apache Thrift, GraphQL, OData etc are currently not supported.

There are 2 REST API standards supported in Freshworks products for defining the API specifications namely [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md) (formerly Swagger) and [Open API 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/#:~:text=The%20OpenAPI%20Specification%20(OAS)%20defines,or%20through%20network%20traffic%20inspection.). The other common API documentation standards such as [RAML](https://raml.org/), [JsonAPI](https://jsonapi.org/), [OData](https://www.odata.org/) etc are currently not supported

## Who should be reading this document?

Freshworks internal product development teams, adding API documentation support for their Public API offering should follow these guidelines

## What is in it for me?

Freshworks internal common teams namely Tech Writing and DevRel use these API specs for adding API document and SDK support for your products respectively. A well documented API will be used for extending these services if it adheres to defined standards.

## Where can I find these standards?

[Open API 2.0 standard](/styles/oas%202.0/oas-2.0.md)
[Open API 3.0 standard](/styles/oas%203.x.x/oas-3.x.x.md)
