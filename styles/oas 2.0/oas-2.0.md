# Freshworks OpenAPI 2.0 Style Guide

## What is Open API 2.0 standard?

The Swagger specification is licensed under [The Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

## What is linting?

API linting is the process of making sure that APIs are not just technically correct, but that they also comply with a set of additional constraints that often are documented in the form of API guidelines.

## What is Spectral?

Spectral is an open-source API linting tool by [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/) that allows users to create custom style guides to enforce validations on API design automatically. Typically, these would be in description languages such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or JSON Schema.
